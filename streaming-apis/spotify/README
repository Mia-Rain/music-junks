spotify api
-- random ass scripts for the spotify api
---

---
Spotbash
-- this is generally a replacement for Spotbash
-- while spotbash works, the code is stale, and complex
-- here everything should be well separated
-- scripts have comments describing their usage
---

---
auth
-- most things will require an authkeys file
-- this can be generated with REKEY @ mia-rain.github.io/REKEY
  >>>> sadly a web hosted project is required
  >>>> this could be done locally with some index.html files and junk
  >>>> or with nodejs but the above is the fine normally
---- the above will ask for tokens from a project @ developer.spotify.com
  >> additionally you will need to set the redirect uri to 
  >> https://mia-rain.github.io/REKEY/callback
  >>>> reload and retry if no output is displayed, also allow some time for Spotify to respond
-- see ./AUTH and ./authkeys.example
---- they contain info how to produce an `$AUTHKEY` var and what an authkeys file should look like
  >> at the current moment no system exists to refresh the key after a given time
  >> the time is likely always the same but one would need to have a timestamp with the key
  >> and ask `date(1)` constantly for the current timestamp; which is complex and annoying
  >>>> however do note that Spotify does and will rate-limit free accounts
  >>>>>> nothing here requires a premium account
  >>>>>> only the player sdk "requires" a premium account

general hints
-- almost everything will need AUTHKEY to be exported
-- scripts have info about the required scopes
-- scripts will only make references to others in comments
-- everything requires curl
-- something may require jq
---- however I make many attempts to prevent it
-- I recommend using zsh over bash/dash as zsh is much faster
---- scripts found here should avoid using IFS to prevent compat issues
---- unless otherwise stated, thus zsh compatibly should be fine
