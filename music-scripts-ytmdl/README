music-scripts
-- music collection and playlist building scripts
---

---
deps
-- ytmdl, mediainfo, spotbash
---

---
info
-- these scripts make use of ytmdl, and my previous project spotbash
---- spotbash is deprecated but nothing with the same features exists to my knowledge
---- while the code is horrbile, it works very well unless spotify rate limits the user
---

---
issues
-- many issues come from using youtube as the provider
---- I do /NOT/ recommend using this, or any youtube downloader
---- unless you want to follow DMCA laws, or the content is not found elsewhere
  >> there are better options using streaming services with much higher quality
